    <h2>Stand Out</h2>
    <aside><p><em>Open up your eyes take a look at me
If the picture fits in your memory
I've been dreamin by the rhythm like the beat of a heart
And I won't stop until I start to stand out
Some people settle for the typical thing
Livin' all their lives waitin' in the wings
It ain't a question of 'if', just a matter of time
Before I move to the front of the line
And once you're watchin' ev'ry move that I make
Ya gotta believe that I got what it takes
To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out 'til you notice me
If the squeaky wheels always gettin' the grease
I'm totally devoted to disturbin' the peace
And I'll do it all again, when I get it done
Until I become your number one
No method to the madness and means of escape
Gonna break every rule I'll bend them all out of shape
It ain't a question of 'how' just a matter of when
You get the message that I'm tryin' to send
I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head
And you know I'm going all of the way, till the end
To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out 'til you notice me, yeah
If I could make you stop and take a look at me instead of just
Walkin' by
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
If it was gettin' you to notice
I'm alive
All I need is half a chance, a second thought, a second glance'll prove
I got whatever it takes
It's a piece of cake
To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out
Stand out, hey
Stand out!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Stand out!
(Hmph!)
'Til mine's the only face you see
Gonna stand out
'Til you notice me</em></p></aside>

     <aside><p><em>OOGIE BOOGIE:
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first
When Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
Then there's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time now
That you hear the boogie song, ohhh
THREE BATS:
Ohhh
OOGIE BOOGIE:
Ohhh
SEVEN LIZARDS:
Ohhh
OOGIE BOOGIE:
Ohhh
SEVEN LIZARDS:
Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man
OOGIE BOOGIE:
Well if I'm feelin' antsy
And there's nothin' much to do
I might just cook a special batch
Of snake and spider stew
And don't ya know the one thing
That would make it work so nice?
A roly-poly Sandy Claws to add a little spice
THREE SKELETONS:
Ohhh
OOGIE BOOGIE:
Oh, yeah
Ohhh
OOGIE BOOGIE:
Ohhh
THREE BATS:
Ohhh
OOGIE BOOGIE AND THREE SKELETONS:
Oh, yeah, I'm (he's) the Oogie Boogie Man
SANTA:
Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses
OOGIE BOOGIE:
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny, I'm laughing
You really are too much
And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff
SANTA:
What are you going to do?
OOGIE BOOGIE:
I'm gonna do the best I can
Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair
It's much more fun, I must confess
When lives are on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine
SANTA:
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act
OOGIE BOOGIE:
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere</em></p></aside>
